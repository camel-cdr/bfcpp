# Optimizing Brainfuck interpreter in the C preprocessor

A C99 confirming\* optimizing Brainfuck implementation written (and executed) only using the C preprocessor.

\*If you find something that does not confirm to the standard or is unspecified/undefined, please open an issue.

# Example

<table><tr><td><b>Hello World</b></td><td><b>Output</b></td></tr><tr><td>

```c
#include "bf.c"

BF((),I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,B,R,I,I,I,I,B,R,I,I,R,I,I,

# Getting started

Since the preprocessor can't distinguish between the standard Brainfuck symbols, this implementation uses the following alternative instruction names:

| Original | Instruction | Description                                                       |
| ---      | ---         | ---                                                               |
| >        | R           | Move the tape head to the right                                   |
| <        | L           | Move the tape head to the left                                    |
| +        | I           | Increment the tape head                                           |
| -        | D           | Decrement the tape head                                           |
| .        | A           | Output the tape head as ASCII\*                                   |
|          | O           | Output the tape head as a hexadecimal number                      |
| ,        | G           | Read an input character and set the tape head to it               |
| [        | B           | Jump past the matching ] if the cell at the pointer is 0          |
| ]        | E           | Jump back to the matching [ if the cell at the pointer is nonzero |

\*Note that there might be extra space inserted between symbols, because all preprocessors I know of disagree when spaces are inserted in `S(a)b` with `#define S(x) x` and different tokens in `a` and `b`.

## Compilers/preprocessors

The fastest preprocessor I know of is the one in [tcc](https://repo.or.cz/w/tinycc.git).
For gcc make sure to use the `-ftrack-macro-expansion=0` options and for clang use the `-fmacro-backtrace-limit=1` options.
If you can't use tcc I recommend using gcc instead of clang, because it's faster, and it gives you incremental output.

If you want to get more fine grain information of execution times, then you might want to patch tinycc with [tinycc.diff](tinycc.diff).
This adds the `__TIMER__` macro, which expands to the executed time and resets the timer, so the second `__TIMER__` in `__TIMER__ FOO __TIMER__` expands to the time it took to preprocess `FOO`.
